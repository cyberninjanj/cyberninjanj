- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cyberninjanj
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in HTML, CSS, JS, GDScript and Python
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and GDScript for now
- ðŸš‡ I want to make Video Games, create OG 90s looking websites (and maybe work on a SA-MP server?)
- I am only able to code by peeking through tutorials.
- I'm an idiot tbh
